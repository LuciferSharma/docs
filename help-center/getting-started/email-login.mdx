### Can I login with an email account?

Yes, we allow users to login with email accounts from any email provider, except spam email addresses. Visit our [login page](https://app.quickreel.io/login) to get started.

### What if I want to login through email verification instead of Google login?

We provide login options via both Google and email. If you created your account using Google, you can add an email login method to it, using the same email address associated with your Google account.

Here's how to set up email verification login:

1. Log out of your account created with Google
2. Visit [QuickReel login page](https://app.quickreel.io/login) and enter the same email address associated with your Google account
3. You will receive a verification code via email
4. Use this code to log in

Once set up, your team members can log in to QuickReel directly using this email address and the verification code sent to it.
